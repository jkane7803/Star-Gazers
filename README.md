# Star-Gazers

# This was a term long group portfolio project created by Justice Kane and Smith Breaux for the class "CS 340 - Introduction to Databases" at Oregon State University. Everything here was based on the materials and resources provided to us by our instructors, Dr. Michael Curry and Danielle Safonte, and by the course CS 340. The document that comes with this code provides an executive summary, overview, database outline, ER diagram, schema, example data, and screenshots of how our website functions. The flip servers used for this project were only temporary for a particular term, and as a result the website for this code no longer works. In theory, this should be easily portable to a simple VSCode folder, with some minor variation in certain files like the db-connector, as long as you have a working database for this website, but just in case there are any technical difficulties, the document should serves as an alternative showcase of our project, albeit being less interactive. Thank you for taking your time reading this, and hope you enjoy our groups code.
